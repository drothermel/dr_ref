# General Project Information Extraction

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive information extraction for a completed project in the dr_plotter repository. Additional specific details about the project directory, timeframe, and output location will be provided separately.

## Required Reading

**CRITICAL**: Before starting, read `docs/processes/project_consolidation_methodology.md` to understand the 6-category framework and extraction standards you must follow.

## Your Task

Conduct exhaustive information extraction across all project documents, organizing findings according to the 6 consolidation categories defined in the methodology document. You will determine the project's scope, objectives, and context entirely from the documents themselves.

### Project Discovery Process

1. **Initial Survey**: Read project README or main summary document first to understand project context
2. **Document Inventory**: Catalog all files and their apparent purposes  
3. **Chronological Review**: Order documents by creation date or logical sequence
4. **Systematic Extraction**: Apply the 6-category framework to all documents

### Extraction Requirements

For each of the 6 categories, provide:

1. **Structured findings** with specific file:line references
2. **Direct quotes** from source documents as evidence
3. **Timeline information** showing project evolution
4. **Cross-references** between related findings

### Output Format

Organize your findings as:

```markdown
# [PROJECT NAME] - Information Extraction

[Brief factual summary of what you discovered about the project]

## Category 1: What Was Done and Why

## Category 6: Evergreen Information

### Supporting Evidence
### Timeline Notes

## Document Review Summary
[List all documents reviewed with brief notes on their relevance]

## Gaps and Uncertainties
[Note any missing information or unclear areas]
```

## Quality Standards

- **Completeness**: Review every single document in the project directory
- **Evidence-Based**: All findings must include specific file references and quotes
- **Objectivity**: Report what documents actually say, not your interpretations
- **Discovery-Oriented**: Let the documents tell you what the project was about

## Key Questions to Answer

As you extract information, pay attention to:
- What was this project trying to accomplish and why was it important?
- How did the project's scope and approach evolve over time?
- What technical, process, or coordination challenges emerged?
- What work remains incomplete or could be built upon?
- Where can users find current documentation about the results?
- What methodologies, patterns, or approaches are worth preserving for future use?

## Important Notes

- This is information EXTRACTION, not analysis or synthesis
- Provide raw, organized data that a synthesis agent can work with
- Include specific quotes and file references for all major findings
- Note contradictions or uncertainties you encounter
- Focus on facts from documents, not your interpretations
- Determine project context entirely from the documents themselves

Your extraction will serve as the foundation for creating consolidated project summaries and updating methodology guides.

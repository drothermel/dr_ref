# Audit Methodology

## Overview

## 5-Stage Pipeline

### Validated Framework from Architectural Enhancement (2025-08-28)
**Source**: 37 audit reports across 5 architectural categories with 3-4 independent agents

**Stage 1: Independent Multi-Agent Assessment**
- Deploy 3-4 independent agents without inter-agent communication
- Each agent conducts comprehensive analysis without influence from others
- Generate complete coverage across all audit categories
- Maintain diverse analytical perspectives

**Stage 2: Systematic Disagreement Analysis** 
- Explicit identification of agent agreement patterns
- Categorize consensus claims (â‰¥75% agreement) vs. disputed claims
- Prioritize areas requiring deeper investigation based on disagreement patterns
- Recognize that disagreements often indicate valuable validation opportunities

**Stage 3: Evidence-Based Verification**
- Empirical validation of all claims through direct analysis
- Require specific evidence with file references for all findings
- Actively seek counter-examples to test claim validity
- Maintain evidence strength classification (strong/moderate/weak/none)

**Stage 4: Evidence-Weighted Synthesis**
- Generate recommendations based on evidence strength rather than agent vote counts
- Provide specific implementation guidance with confidence levels
- Include risk assessment for each recommendation
- Distinguish between high-confidence findings and areas requiring further investigation

**Stage 5: Cross-Category Integration**
- Unified implementation planning considering dependencies across audit domains
- Resource optimization and sequencing based on interdependency analysis
- Conflict identification and systematic resolution
- Coordination of implementation across multiple architectural areas

**Quantitative Validation**: This framework processed 130+ files of analysis and produced actionable implementation guidance that resulted in successful architectural transformation with zero breaking changes.

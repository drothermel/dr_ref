# Faceted Plotting Implementation (August 2025)

## What Was Done and Why

**Strategic Objective**: Implementation of native multi-dimensional data visualization capabilities in dr_plotter, transforming complex manual subplot management into systematic, reusable API patterns.

**Business Problem Addressed**: Researchers were required to write 95+ lines of manual subplot coordination code for multi-dimensional visualizations, creating brittle, non-reusable solutions that increased maintenance burden and reduced research productivity.

**Core Functionality Implemented**:
- **Native Faceting API**: Single-call interface for complex multi-dimensional plotting (`fm.plot_faceted()`)
- **2Ã—4 Grid Support**: Systematic coordination of multiple subplot layouts with consistent styling
- **Style Coordination**: Automated color and legend management across subplot combinations
- **Validation System**: Comprehensive parameter validation and error handling

**Technical Implementation Results**:
- Achieved 94/94 specialized faceting tests passing
- Maintained 141/141 total test suite passing (zero regression)
- Integrated with existing SubplotFacetingConfig infrastructure
- Coordinated with theme system for consistent styling

**Success Criteria Met**: Delivered intuitive API for complex visualizations while maintaining fine-grained control options and achieving comprehensive test coverage.

## Scope and Scale Evolution Over Time

**Initial Scope**: The project began with basic faceting requirements focused on simple grid layouts and basic subplot coordination. Early specifications anticipated straightforward implementation building on existing infrastructure.

**6-Phase Systematic Development**: Project evolved into comprehensive 6-chunk implementation approach:
1. Foundation and data structures development
2. Grid computation and layout logic
3. Basic integration with existing plotting infrastructure
4. Advanced layout and coordination features
5. Style system integration and coordination
6. Validation and testing completion

**Architectural Integration Requirements**: Implementation revealed need for deeper integration with dr_plotter's configuration and styling systems than initially anticipated, requiring coordination with parallel architectural enhancement work.

**Testing and Validation Expansion**: Scope expanded from basic functionality testing to comprehensive validation including edge cases, error conditions, and integration scenarios, resulting in 94 specialized test cases.

**Documentation and Migration Support**: Project scope grew to include complete API reference documentation and migration guides to support user transition from manual subplot management.

## Challenges Encountered

**Infrastructure Coordination**: The primary challenge was coordinating faceting implementation with ongoing architectural enhancement work, requiring careful sequencing to avoid conflicts between foundation changes and feature development.

**Style System Integration**: Achieving consistent color coordination and legend management across multiple subplots required deeper integration with the styling system than initially planned, particularly for shared legend strategies.

**Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility with existing plotting interfaces while introducing new faceting capabilities required careful API design to avoid disrupting established user workflows.

**Performance Considerations**: Complex grid layouts with multiple subplots introduced performance considerations for large datasets that required optimization strategies beyond the initial implementation scope.

**Testing Complexity**: Comprehensive testing of multi-dimensional subplot combinations created complex test scenarios requiring systematic validation approaches to ensure reliability across all supported configurations.

**Resolution Approaches**: The project addressed these challenges through:
- Systematic integration testing with existing infrastructure
- Iterative refinement of style coordination mechanisms  
- Comprehensive documentation and examples for user transition
- Performance profiling and optimization for large dataset scenarios

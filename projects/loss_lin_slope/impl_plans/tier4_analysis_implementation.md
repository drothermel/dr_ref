## ‚ö†Ô∏è ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FROM TIER 3 REVIEW (Added 2025-01-01)

**NOTE**: The following items may become relevant during implementation. They were identified during Tier 3 review but are not critical for the core logging infrastructure.

### Data Format Considerations

1. **JSON to CSV Conversion**
   - Tier 3 will log to dr_exp's metrics.jsonl format
   - Tier 4 needs to implement conversion utilities for pandas analysis
   - Example utility needed:
     ```python
     def convert_metrics_jsonl_to_csv(experiment_dir):
         """Convert dr_exp metrics.jsonl to CSV for analysis."""
     ```

2. **Analysis Functions Status Update**
   - ‚úÖ **Deferred to Tier 4**: `knee_detector.py`, `power_law_fitter.py`, `metric_validator.py`
   - ‚úÖ **Directory Created**: `src/deconcnn/analysis/` in Tier 3 Commit 1
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Power Law Consolidation**: Extract from `noise_monitor.py:102-107` to avoid duplication
   - üìã **Implementation Priority**: Phase 1 of Tier 4 implementation

3. **Library Strategy Updates**
   - BackPACK is being used for trace estimation (more efficient)
   - PyHessian reserved for spectral analysis only
   - No `hutch_nn` library exists - use PyHessian or BackPACK features

4. **Dependencies Already Added**
   - All visualization libraries (pandas, matplotlib, etc.) already in deconCNN
   - BackPACK already added for trace estimation
   - No need to add these again

5. **Potential Resource Optimizations**
   - Workers per GPU will be determined by Tier 3 testing
   - May vary by experiment variant (BN-off may need fewer workers)
   - Check Tier 3 results before assuming 3 workers per GPU

## Agent Instructions
**IMPORTANT: Read these before starting implementation**

1. **Quality Gates**: Before EVERY commit:
   - Run `lint_fix` and resolve all issues
   - Run tests and ensure they pass
   - Fix any issues found, even if pre-existing

2. **Progress Tracking**: 
   - Mark each step with ‚úÖ when complete
   - Add notes in [brackets] for any deviations
   - Update the "Current Status" section after each work session

3. **Adaptation Protocol**:
   - Follow the plan but use judgment
   - Document any necessary modifications in [brackets]
   - Flag significant changes for retrospective

4. **Commit Message Protocol**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Use the EXACT commit message provided in each step
   - Messages are marked with "Use exact message: `<message>`"
   - Do NOT modify, add to, or abbreviate the provided commit messages
   - Each commit should be atomic and focused on a single logical change
   - If a step has no commit message, no commit is needed for that step

- **Hutch++ Upgrade**: Improve existing Hutchinson trace estimator to O(1/Œµ) complexity
- **Power Law Fitting**: Enhance existing log-log regression from NoiseMonitor with outlier detection
- **FFT Analysis**: Refactor existing Welch's method and mid-frequency band filtering from NoiseMonitor
- **Statistical Testing**: Add proper multiple comparison corrections and effect sizes

### Integration Requirements
- **Native deconCNN Integration**: Analysis suite lives within deconCNN project structure
- **Callback Compatibility**: Extracted functions must match existing callback behavior exactly
- **Direct Data Access**: Use Lightning's built-in metric collection and existing checkpoint data
- **Hydra Configuration**: Leverage existing Hydra config system for analysis script parameters

### Performance Targets
- **Analysis Efficiency**: Process 216 experimental runs without memory issues

- **Regression Tests**: Ensure compatibility with existing deconCNN training workflows
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end analysis pipeline with real deconCNN experimental data

## Risk Mitigation Updates

### **Critical Implementation Risks**
1. **Callback Compatibility Risk**: Create comprehensive regression tests before extraction
   - Mitigation: Baseline test all callback outputs before making changes
   - Verification: Side-by-side comparison of outputs before/after refactoring

2. **Memory Issues During Hutch++ Upgrade**: Monitor memory usage during curvature analysis
   - Mitigation: Test on smaller models first, implement memory monitoring
   - Verification: Ensure <15% total runtime overhead as specified in plan

3. **Directory Access Limitations**: Verify session working directory includes deconCNN
   - Mitigation: Use absolute paths, verify repository access before starting
   - Verification: Test write/read permissions in target directories

4. **Dependency Conflicts**: Test new visualization packages with existing PyTorch stack
   - Mitigation: Install incrementally, test imports after each addition
   - Verification: Ensure existing functionality continues to work

### **Quality Assurance Protocol**
- **Before each commit**: Run `lint_fix` and resolve all issues
- **After each phase**: Run `pt` to ensure tests pass
- **Before extraction**: Create baseline comparison data
- **After extraction**: Verify identical behavior with integration tests

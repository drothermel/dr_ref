# Critical Issues Found

1. Incomplete Unit Test Structure
- Several test commits create test files but don't specify if they should use pytest fixtures, mocking strategies, or how to handle
PyTorch/Lightning components
- No guidance on mocking the Lightning trainer for unit tests

2. YAML Configuration Ambiguity

- The plan shows YAML snippets but doesn't clarify if these replace entire files or are partial updates
- No mention of Hydra's config group structure or where callback configs should go

3. Missing Error Scenarios

- What if BaseMonitor doesn't exist or has a different interface?
- What if the existing callbacks don't follow expected patterns?
- No fallback if dependencies are missing

4. Script Execution Context

- Shell scripts don't specify working directory requirements
- Python scripts don't show shebang lines or how they find imports

5. Missing Validation Steps

- No verification that dr_exp is properly configured before submitting jobs
- No check that SLURM paths exist before manual execution
- No validation of singularity/container availability

6. Data Export Ambiguity

- The CSV export shows column definitions but not how to extract these metrics from experiment outputs
- Where do RÂ² values come from? Need to calculate or extract?

7. Recovery Script Assumptions

- The failure recovery script assumes certain error message formats
- No guidance on where error logs are stored or how to access them

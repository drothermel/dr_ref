Critical Issues Found:

1. Python Import Paths Ambiguity

- The plan shows imports like from dr_exp_utils import list_decon_jobs (line 545) but doesn't specify where this module is or how to
import it
- No clear instruction on whether dr_exp needs to be in PYTHONPATH or installed

2. Incomplete Unit Test Structure

- Several test commits create test files but don't specify if they should use pytest fixtures, mocking strategies, or how to handle
PyTorch/Lightning components
- No guidance on mocking the Lightning trainer for unit tests

3. YAML Configuration Ambiguity

- The plan shows YAML snippets but doesn't clarify if these replace entire files or are partial updates
- No mention of Hydra's config group structure or where callback configs should go

4. Missing Error Scenarios

- What if BaseMonitor doesn't exist or has a different interface?
- What if the existing callbacks don't follow expected patterns?
- No fallback if dependencies are missing

5. Slope Calculation Implementation Details

- The plan mentions "using least squares" but doesn't show the actual implementation
- Should it use numpy.polyfit, scipy, or statsmodels?
- How to handle edge cases like insufficient data points?

6. Script Execution Context

- Shell scripts don't specify working directory requirements
- Python scripts don't show shebang lines or how they find imports

7. Integration Points Unclear

- How does LossSlopeLogger access trainer.callback_metrics?
- When/how are callbacks registered with the trainer?
- How does the callback know when 0.25 epochs have passed?

8. Missing Validation Steps

- No verification that dr_exp is properly configured before submitting jobs
- No check that SLURM paths exist before manual execution
- No validation of singularity/container availability

9. Data Export Ambiguity

- The CSV export shows column definitions but not how to extract these metrics from experiment outputs
- Where do RÂ² values come from? Need to calculate or extract?

10. Recovery Script Assumptions

- The failure recovery script assumes certain error message formats
- No guidance on where error logs are stored or how to access them

# Implementation Plan: Tier 4 Analysis Suite (deconCNN)

## 📋 Context from Tier 3 Implementation

**What Tier 3 Accomplished:**
- ✅ Created `src/deconcnn/analysis/` directory structure (existing from prior work)
- ✅ Implemented LossSlopeLogger callback with slope calculation (alpha_5_15, alpha_full)
- ✅ Configured CurvatureMonitor (500-step frequency) and NoiseMonitor (2-epoch frequency)
- ✅ Created monitoring script `scripts/monitor_experiment.py` for job tracking
- ✅ Set up basic failure recovery in `scripts/recover_failed.py`
- ✅ Created validation notebook `notebooks/validate_metrics_basic.ipynb` with H1/H2 checks
- ✅ Created operational documentation `docs/operational_runbook_basic.md`
- ✅ Added dependencies: pandas>=2.3.0, matplotlib>=3.10.3, statsmodels>=0.14.4, rich>=14.0.0
- ✅ Established dr_exp metrics.jsonl logging format
- ✅ Created data pipeline scripts: `collect_and_archive.sh`, `verify_completeness.py`, `prepare_dataset.py`
- ✅ Created test scripts: `validate_local.py`, `test_harness.py` 
- ✅ Created submission wrapper `scripts/submit_all_loss_slope.sh` for 216-job sweep
- ✅ Created utils module and extract EWMA

- Advanced SLURM job submission and monitoring infrastructure
- Intelligent failure recovery with pattern analysis
- Efficient result collection and archival systems
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Data format conversion utilities (JSON to CSV/Parquet)
- Missing visualization dependencies (seaborn, plotly, jupyter)

## Agent Instructions
**IMPORTANT: Read these before starting implementation**

1. **Quality Gates**: Before EVERY commit:
   - Run `lint_fix` and resolve all issues
   - Run tests and ensure they pass
   - Fix any issues found, even if pre-existing

2. **Progress Tracking**: 
   - Mark each step with ✅ when complete
   - Add notes in [brackets] for any deviations
   - Update the "Current Status" section after each work session

3. **Adaptation Protocol**:
   - Follow the plan but use judgment
   - Document any necessary modifications in [brackets]
   - Flag significant changes for retrospective

4. **Commit Message Protocol**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Use the EXACT commit message provided in each step
   - Messages are marked with "Use exact message: `<message>`"
   - Do NOT modify, add to, or abbreviate the provided commit messages
   - Each commit should be atomic and focused on a single logical change
   - If a step has no commit message, no commit is needed for that step

5. **Implementation Philosophy**:
   - Build on existing foundations from Tier 3
   - Extract and consolidate existing code to avoid duplication
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing callbacks
   - Cross-validate extensively against current behavior

## Technical Guidelines

### Mathematical Approach
- Use AIC = 2k - 2ln(L) for model comparison (k = parameters, L = likelihood)
- Implement Hutch++ for O(1/ε) complexity trace estimation
- Enhance power law fitting with robust outlier detection
- Use Welch's method for spectral analysis with proper windowing

### Integration Philosophy  
- Maintain native deconCNN integration within project structure
- Ensure extracted functions match existing callback behavior exactly
- Leverage Lightning's metric collection and checkpoint systems
- Use Hydra configuration for all analysis script parameters

### Performance Requirements
- Process 216 experimental runs without memory issues
- Maintain <15% overhead for callback operations
- Enable parallel processing for large-scale analysis
- Implement graceful error handling for incomplete data

### Validation Approach
- Cross-validate all extracted functions against originals
- Use synthetic data for testing new mathematical functions
- Maintain comprehensive regression test suite
- Perform end-to-end testing with real experimental data

## Risk Mitigation Updates

### **Critical Implementation Risks**
1. **Callback Compatibility Risk**: Create comprehensive regression tests before extraction
   - Mitigation: Baseline test all callback outputs before making changes
   - Verification: Side-by-side comparison of outputs before/after refactoring

2. **Memory Issues During Hutch++ Upgrade**: Monitor memory usage during curvature analysis
   - Mitigation: Test on smaller models first, implement memory monitoring
   - Verification: Ensure <15% total runtime overhead as specified in plan

3. **Directory Access Limitations**: Verify session working directory includes deconCNN
   - Mitigation: Use absolute paths, verify repository access before starting
   - Verification: Test write/read permissions in target directories

4. **Dependency Conflicts**: Test new visualization packages with existing PyTorch stack
   - Mitigation: Install incrementally, test imports after each addition
   - Verification: Ensure existing functionality continues to work

### **Quality Assurance Protocol**
- **Before each commit**: Run `lint_fix` and resolve all issues
- **After each phase**: Run `pt` to ensure tests pass
- **Before extraction**: Create baseline comparison data
- **After extraction**: Verify identical behavior with integration tests

## Handoff Instructions
To continue this implementation:
1. Read the full plan and agent instructions
2. Check "Current Status" to see where we are  
3. Use TodoWrite to plan your work session
4. Find the first unchecked [ ] commit
5. Implement exactly what that commit describes
6. Run `lint_fix` before committing
7. Move to the next commit (often a test commit)
8. Update "Current Status" when stopping work

**Critical**: Follow the atomic commit pattern - each commit should do exactly ONE thing. Don't bundle changes together.

**Key Principles**:
1. Every implementation commit is followed by a test commit
2. Each commit does exactly ONE thing
3. Functions are extracted and tested before enhancement
4. Scripts are created only after their dependencies are tested
5. Integration testing validates the complete system

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for every new function
- Integration tests for extracted functions
- End-to-end tests for analysis scripts
- Notebook verification for all visualizations
- Final integration test of complete pipeline

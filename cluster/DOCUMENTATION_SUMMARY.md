# Cluster Documentation Summary

## What Was Created

I've created comprehensive cluster documentation based on insights gained from the dr_exp codebase. This documentation captures critical knowledge that would have been invaluable when initially planning the Tier 3 implementation.

### Files Created

1. **[README.md](README.md)**
   - Central navigation hub
   - Quick command reference
   - Best practices checklist
   - Document overview

2. **[CLUSTER_OVERVIEW.md](CLUSTER_OVERVIEW.md)**
   - Hardware specs (RTX 8000 GPUs, memory, storage)
   - Software environment (Singularity, UV, Python)
   - SLURM configuration basics
   - GPU sharing with CUDA MPS
   - Directory structure and paths

3. **[JOB_SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md](JOB_SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md)**
   - **Critical finding**: Environment variable propagation issues
   - Four submission methods ranked by reliability
   - Embedded parameters method (most reliable)
   - Safety features and best practices
   - Resource allocation guidelines

4. **[DR_EXP_INTEGRATION.md](DR_EXP_INTEGRATION.md)**
   - Complete guide to the experiment management system
   - Job submission via Python API and CLI
   - Worker management and launcher configuration
   - Integration patterns for training code
   - Monitoring and result collection

5. **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**
   - Common issues with proven solutions
   - GPU memory and gradient explosion fixes
   - Worker failure diagnosis
   - Performance optimization tips
   - Emergency recovery procedures

6. **[EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md)**
   - Real working code from production
   - Complete submission workflows
   - Parameter sweep patterns
   - Monitoring and analysis scripts
   - Failure recovery automation

## Key Insights Captured

### 1. Environment Variable Issue
The most critical finding: SLURM's `--export=ALL` doesn't work reliably on this cluster. This affects how parameters are passed to jobs and would have caused significant debugging time.

**Solution**: Always use the embedded parameters method where values are hardcoded into generated scripts.

### 2. Infrastructure Specifics
- Uses Singularity containers (not Docker)
- Requires `.ext3` overlay files for custom environments
- CUDA MPS enables efficient GPU sharing
- Specific paths: `/scratch/ddr8143/` for storage

### 3. dr_exp Integration
- Sophisticated job queue management system
- Built-in duplicate detection and logging
- Background sync for results
- Structured approach to large experiments

### 4. Best Practices
- Test with single jobs before scaling
- Use priority system intelligently
- Monitor early and often
- Implement retry logic for failures
- Compress checkpoints before archiving

## Why This Documentation Matters

Having this documentation from the start would have:
1. Avoided the environment variable pitfall
2. Provided tested patterns for job submission
3. Clarified the dr_exp architecture and usage
4. Offered proven troubleshooting strategies
5. Saved hours of trial-and-error debugging

This documentation now serves as a comprehensive reference for anyone running experiments on the NYU HPC cluster, particularly when using the dr_exp ecosystem.
